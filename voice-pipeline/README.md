# voice-pipeline (DEPRECATED)

This directory is a **standalone copy** of the voice pipeline that predates
the integrated version. It is kept for reference only.

**Canonical source:** `src/voice_pipeline/` (in the repo root)

Do **not** develop here. All new work should target `src/voice_pipeline/`,
which uses `from src.voice_pipeline.*` imports (this copy uses `from src.*`).
